  ['Equalizer', 'A five-band EQ with presets, and a loudness boost on Android.'],

export const FAQ = [
  ['Is Triptych free?', 'Yes. It is free and open source, with no subscription, ads or account of ours to sign up for.'],
  ['Do I need a Jellyfin server?', 'Yes. Triptych plays music from a Jellyfin server, and does not include music of its own. Jellyfin is free too, and runs on Windows, macOS, Linux and most NAS boxes.'],
  ['Can I play Spotify or Apple Music songs with it?', 'No. Triptych plays music files you own that are on your Jellyfin server. The Spotify, Apple Music and Nothing options only change how the app looks.'],
  ['Does it work away from home?', 'Yes, as long as your phone can reach your server, for example through a VPN like Tailscale or a public address. Songs you download play with no connection at all.'],
  ['What happens to my data?', 'Your library and listening history stay on your device and your own server. A few optional lookups (missing cover art, lyrics and update checks) talk to outside services, and the Privacy Policy lists exactly what is sent.'],
  ['Which devices are supported?', 'Windows, Linux, Android and iPhone. On iPhone the app is installed by sideloading an unsigned .ipa, for example with AltStore or Sideloadly.']

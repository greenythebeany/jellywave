        // needs to notify the JS side (Player) when focus is lost/regained
        // so playback can pause and auto-resume properly. A bare
        // requestAudioFocus() with an empty callback used to live here:
        // Chromium's own WebView audio pipeline still reacts to focus loss
        // by pausing on its own, but with nothing listening for focus
        // *regain*, playback stayed paused after any interruption (another
        // app's notification sound, switching apps, etc.) until manually
        // resumed — exactly the "stops when backgrounded" symptom this
        // fixes.

        // Volume boosting is handled by LoudnessPlugin instead of here — an
        // always-on LoudnessEnhancer used to live in this file, but it broke
        // Bluetooth AVRCP volume sync on at least one car head unit, so it's
        // now a single fixed-gain attempt tied to actual playback starting
        // rather than something that runs unconditionally from launch.
